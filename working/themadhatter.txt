The Mad Hatter
A tiny and rude hatter who lives in perpetual tea-time.|The Mad Hatter enjoys frustrating Alice and will attack if scared.
Lovely lovely, I love me a good break time!!! I sure wish I could find my watch,|to know if there is somewhere I should be. Whoa who is that who has snuck up on me.|[The hatter takes a defensive stance and attempts to lash out!!]
Oh my, Alice is that you. I didn't even notice that was you I am terribly sorry that I hurt you,|You scared me. [The Mad Hatter has taken your life!]
Ouch that hurt! Why would you attack me, its not like I attacked you first or anything like that.|[The Mad Hatter runs away in fear dropping his hat during his fast escape!]
