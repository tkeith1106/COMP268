You....You did it!! You beat the King and Queen of Hearts. They planned to play you dirty and you
managed to overcome them!!!! Congratulations. Now that they are defeated lets get you home,
where you will be safe forever.

[The White Rabbit leads you inside of his hut]

It has been wonderful getting to meet you and everyone here will miss you forever!
Good luck with the rest of your Life

[The White Rabbit pulls out a large book and hits you with it, jolting you awake,
as you come to your senses you realize that it was all just a very bad dream and that you
were safe all along in the comfort of your sister lap, while she read her book.
You feel foolish and cannot help but feel like you have a had an eerily similar dream in the past..
the deja vu is real, but you will never forget the adventure that you had in your dream
and will never quite believe that it wasn't real either.....]
