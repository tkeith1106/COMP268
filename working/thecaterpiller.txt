The Caterpillar
A large caterpillar who sits on a giant mushroom while smoking a hookah all day
Who are you? Actually, I do not care. You have intruded on me and deserve to pay the price!|[The caterpillar attempts to incapacitate Alice]
That will teach you for attempting to take me out. You deserved this!!!!|[Alice has been hurt by the caterpillar]
I have been squashed literally like a bug. Oh the horror and agony!!!!!!!|[The caterpillar has been defeated!]
